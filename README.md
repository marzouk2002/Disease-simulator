# Disease simulator

this project as the title suggests is a web app meant to simulate the propagation of a disease within a community. the user can play around with parameters as they want and the program will try to simulate the propagation in the population with the given params.
I want to explain some stuff here:

1- schema:

- green dote => healthy person
- red dote => sick person
- blue dote => immune person (this can be from a vaccine or he already got the diseases and survived)
- black dote => dead person
