#Disease simulator

this project as the title suggests is a web app meant to simulate the propagation of a disease within a community. the user can play around with parameters as they want and the program will try to simulate the propagation with the given params.
I want to explain some stuff here:

1- schema:

- green dote => healthy person
- red dote => sick person
- blue dote => immune person (this can be from a vaccine or he already got the diseases and survived)
- black dote => dead person

2- You can imagine that the map (grid) that represents people as it is linked from both sides. So if the disease started from one side it can move to there (and I think it's more realistic because people are not restricted by borders within their community).
